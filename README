Only a couple of files are missing which are necessary to get this class to work.
They'll appear shortly.

Once they're available, usage of this class is simple.

As a command line utility:
./sqlitefs.py ~/.config/chromium/Defaults/History /tmp/ChromiumHistory

As a code object:
sqlitefs = system.Code("/System/Storage.lib/Filesystems/sqlitefs/sqlitefs.py")['SqliteFilesystem']
fs = sqlitefs("~/.config/chromium/Defaults/History").attach("/tmp/ChromiumHistory")
